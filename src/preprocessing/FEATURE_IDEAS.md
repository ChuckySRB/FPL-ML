# Feature Planing

My ideas for new features that could be tested:
1) Best 5\3 day average points streak => Find best 5-3 days points streak this season so far and add it as a feature
2) Deffencive Contributions => Add this for deffenders and middlefielders for the new scoring calculations, if deffender has 10dc => 2 points, if middlefielder has 12dc => 2 points (we will implement this at the end for the season 2025-2026, ignor for now)
3) If RedCard last game => 0 points
4) Return Consistency Score => Instead of relying solely on average points or streaks, calculate the percentage of games where a player scores 5 or more points, along with the standard deviation of their historical points. This metric helps the model differentiate between players who consistently deliver returns versus volatile players who rely on unpredictable point hauls.
